We're happy to announce the first public release of the ACROSS Workshop, hosted right here on whodoesthe.dev

## What's up with the name?

The ACROSS Workshops are focused on identifying who does the work, hence the URL. 

## How can I get started? 

Head on over to our [first workshop](/workshops/multiplayer/)!

## I have a comment/bug/issue
